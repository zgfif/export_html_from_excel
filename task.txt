Summary

I need a small program programmed with Python, to export html pages from the Excel file
there are two columns in Excel: url and html. The exported webpage should be named 
with "column:url", and the page content is "column:html". Attached you will find the 
Excel sample, and 1 exported page sample. Finally, the program will get me 10 webpages totally.
But if there is 1000 rows in the excel, I will get 999 webpages, the first row will 
be ignored. There is also a file named keyword.xlsxï¼Œ the same keyword in the webpage will be 
replaced with the link in the keyword.xlsx

1.html
