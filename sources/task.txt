Summary

I need a small program programmed with python , to export html pages from excel
there are two columns in excel: url and html
the exported webpage should be named with column:url, and the page content is 
column:html
Attached you will find the excel sample, and 1 exported page sample.
Finally, the program will get me 10 webpages totally.
But if there is 1000 rows in the excel, I will get 999 webpages, the first row will 
be ignored.
There is also a file named keyword.xlsxï¼Œ the same keyword in the webpage will be 
replaced with the link in the keyword.xlsx
